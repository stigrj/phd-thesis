\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis presents the implementation of a numerical real-space 
method for the calculation of the electronic structure of molecular systems
within the self-consistent field approximations of quantum chemistry. The
code is based on the multi-resolution multiwavelet basis which provide
sparse representations of functions and operators, in particular integral
operators with Green's function convolution kernels. The mathematical
formalism provides efficient (linear-scaling) algorithms for operator
application, e.g. for the Coulomb operator for the calculation of 
electrostatic potentials, as well as rigorous error control.

The Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham equations of quantum chemistry are reformulated 
in integral form and solved to self-consistency using iterative solution 
techniques. The code is able to attain high-accuracy for many-electron 
molecular systems, both restricted closed-shell and unrestricted open-shell.

Because of the inherent high demands on computational resources that
comes with real-space methods, the code relies on parallel algorithms and
data distribution in order to become competitive with conventional methods,
and the code has been properly adapted in order to utilize modern massively 
parallel computing architectures.
